/*
we are tolk when we have more pages and links on the website it is difficult to
 Routing. now we are going to use some package for that.

 let's tolk about 'node package manager'(npm)
   * 'npm' is default installing when you are installing nodejs.
   * 'npm' is bunch of command line tools which help to install thirdpaty packages or moduls.
   * Express in one of these packages and there are many more.
   * Express package helps us with Routing and templating and such.

 to get Express package
   1. go to www.npmjs.com and search 'express' and look info.
   2. and install package as there syses
        $ npm install express
   3. it will make 'node_modules' folder on current directory to all dependency with Express package.
   4. but we don't wont the other dependency packages. to unstall Express
       $ npm uninstall express
   5. it will leave only 'bin' inside 'node_modules' folder. but for me it's install only express file.
