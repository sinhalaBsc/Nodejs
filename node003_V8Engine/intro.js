          what is JavaScript Engines
          
 Computer can't understand JavaScript language.To do understand JavaScript to the computer we need 
 convert JavaScript code to machine code. "JavaScript Engines"(a program) doing this job
 in our computer. with using this engine we can run programs which written in JavaScript on computer.

               Node.js
 Node.js is also written in c++ .Node.js only make  environment to run v8 engine on OS and this engine 
 only generate machine codes from javascript files and libraries which store in node.js code by js programmers.
