to see what is on create 'redisnode001.pub' file
$ nano redisnode001.pub
you can open this file using texteditor and copy this key 

to connect using terminal

install nodejs on digitalocean server

to update ubuntu server
$ sudo apt-get update

to install nodejs server
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ nodejs -v

to install npm
$ sudo apt-get install npm
$ npm -v


you need install only one from following cmd
to install only express 
$ sudo npm install -g express
to install  express with generator for control system 
$ sudo npm install -g express express-generator

to install npm in project directory
$ npm install

set listen port number as 80 to make listen default port of relative domain .
This mean you don't need add additional port number end of domain name.
(change on app.js file)
app.listen(80);

set automatically startup the app.js file
this will very useful when server get reboot for some reson.
first you need to install "pm2" as globally
$ sudo npm install -g pm2 
secondly set 'app.js' file running continuously. 
with running using 'node app.js' this command can't run 'app.js' file  continuously. 
it will stop when close terminal.that's why we should use following commad to run  'app.js' file continuously.
$ sudo pm2 start app.js
if our nodejs app.js file located different
$ sudo pm2 start /root/test/app.js
lastly set run 'pm2' when  startup the system. then 'pm2' will start running his settled background programs. 
this want to do only one time
$ sudo pm2 startup systemd

******** pm2 **********
* pm2 advantages
1)
2)
3)


to add the node app to pm2 (Process Manager)
$ sudo pm2 start app.js
if our nodejs app.js file located different
$ sudo pm2 start /root/test/app.js

to see active js app list
$ pm2 list

to see more details about above app
$ pm2 show 0
0 - id number can get from app list table (see above)

to stop the specific app from pm2 list
$ pm2 stop 0
0 - id number can get from app list table (see above)

to uninstall pm2 using sudo:
$ pm2 kill
$ sudo npm remove pm2 -g
#test with :
$ which pm2

How to edit Nginx setting for big file upload

If the file is too large you may be running into nginx’s clientmaxbody_size which if exceed should 
return a 413 error, though some browsers don’t support actually reporting that error correctly.
You would want to increase this to a larger limit or set it to 0 in which case there will be no limits.
go > $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
change >
http {
    # [...]
    client_max_body_size 100m;
    # [...]
}

If that doesn’t fix it you will want to tail your error logs for both nginx and meteor to see if you 
are getting something more specific and then provide that in your question as there maybe other factors at play.
