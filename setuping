install nodejs on digitalocean server

to update ubuntu server
$ sudo apt-get update

to install nodejs server
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs

you need install only one from following cmd

set listen port number as 80 to make listen default port of relative domain .
This mean you don't need add additional port number end of domain name.
(change on app.js file)
app.listen(80);

set automatically startup the app.js file
this will very useful when server get reboot for some reson.
first you need to install "pm2" as globally
$ sudo npm install -g pm2 
secondly set 'app.js' file running continuously. 
with running using 'node app.js' this command can't run 'app.js' file  continuously. 
it will stop when close terminal.that's why we should use following commad to run  'app.js' file continuously.
$ sudo pm2 start app.js
if our nodejs app.js file located different
$ sudo pm2 start /root/test/app.js
lastly set run 'pm2' when  startup the system. then 'pm2' will start running his settled background programs. 
this want to do only one time
$ sudo pm2 startup systemd

******** pm2 **********
* pm2 advantages
1)

to add the node app to pm2 (Process Manager)
$ sudo pm2 start app.js
